# parakeet
A python script that calculates the time needed to run a specific program (beta)
# Usage
So first of all the script need to calculate what I call a bytetime which is how much time needed to run one byte
that means when you'll run it the first time ,it will calculate it and write a 'bytetime.txt' file , then you'll have to re-run the script.
To run it ,use:
 ```bash
 python main.py [program you wanna calculate]
 ```
 you can remove 'bytetime.txt' but the script we'll have to re-calculate it , and it's recommended to remove it from time to time
